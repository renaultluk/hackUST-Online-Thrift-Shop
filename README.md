# Thriftee
Explore second-hand clothing.

## Introduction
One of the most significant problems that the fashion industry faces today is the high turn-over rates and consumers not maximizing clothing to its full usage. This leads to environmental injustices such as excessive carbon emissions, clothing waste piling up in landfills  and unsustainable water usage. Therefore, through our online marketplace, we want to encourage those to donate their unwanted clothes and thus circulate clothing items to ensure maximum use and sustainability.

## Features
For this hackathon, we have created this website as a way to showcase our project.

There are two main flows of interacting with this website:

#### Customer
As a customer, you can:
1. Browse the marketplace by the 3 categories:
    - Women
    - Men
    - Kids
The marketplace screen contains a list of product cards, each with information such as an image of the item, brand and name of the item, the price and the estimated water consumption used to produce the item.
2. Inspect details of a product by clicking onto a product card
3. Add a product to your cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button
4. Choose your means of delivering the product using the dropdown in the cart, and seeing the CO2 emissions of each method. By choosing to delay on the delivery and choosing less wasting delivery methods, the delivery process becomes more environmentally friendly through easier planning for bulk delivery on delivery companies' part.
5. Check out your cart by clicking on the "Checkout" button

#### Donator
As a donator, you can:
1. Add a product to the marketplace by clicking on the "Add Donation Item" button
2. Input details of your donation item, including name, weight, and images of the item. Once the items are inputted, an estimated amount of rewards given to you will be calculated. The heavier the items, the more you are saving on the emission and waste that goes into producing and distributing the goods, as a result you get a larger sum of rewards. Right now, you get 50 Thriftee Dollars per kg of items donated, which can translate to different vouchers.
3. Submit your donation item by clicking on the "Confirm" button
4. Download an auto-generated shipping label with the information of your donation, including user ID, items donated, estimated rewards, etc. An QR code is also generated on the shipping label to ease the process of processing the donation.
